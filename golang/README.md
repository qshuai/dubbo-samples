## What does this contain

* helloworld

    A simplest example. It contain 'go-client', 'go-server', 'java-server' of dubbo protocol. 
    
* direct

    A direct example. This feature make start of dubbo-go get easy. 
    
* async

    An async example. dubbo-go supports client to call server asynchronously. 

* general

## How to build and run

> Take `helloworld` as an example

java server

```bash
cd helloworld/dubbo/java-server
sh build.sh
cd ./target
tar -zxvf user-info-server-0.2.0-assembly.tar.gz
cd ./user-info-server-0.2.0
sh ./bin/server.sh start
```

java client

```bash
cd helloworld/dubbo/java-client
sh build.sh
cd ./target
tar -zxvf user-info-client-0.2.0-assembly.tar.gz
cd ./user-info-client-0.2.0
sh ./bin/server.sh start
```

go server

* $ARCH = [linux, mac, windows] and $ENV = [dev, release, test]

```bash
cd helloworld/dubbo/go-server
sh ./assembly/$ARCH/$ENV.sh
cd ./target/linux/user_info_server-0.3.1-20190517-0930-release
# $SUFFIX is a suffix of config file,
# such as server_zookeeper.yml when $SUFFIX is "zookeeper", 
# if $SUFFIX = "", default server.yml
sh ./bin/load.sh start $SUFFIX
```

go client

* $ARCH = [linux, mac, windows] and $ENV = [dev, release, test]

```bash
cd helloworld/dubbo/go-client
sh ./assembly/$ARCH/$ENV.sh
cd ./target/linux/user_info_client-0.3.1-20190517-0921-release
# $SUFFIX is a suffix of config file,
# such as client_zookeeper.yml when $SUFFIX = zookeeper", 
# if $SUFFIX = "", config file is client.yml
sh ./bin/load_user_info_client.sh start $SUFFIX
```

## How to contribute

If you want to add some samples, we hope that you can do this:
1. Adding samples in appropriate directory. If you dont' know which directory you should put your samples into, you can get some advices from dubbo-go community.
2. You must run the samples locally and there must be no any error.
3. If your samples have some third party dependency, including another framework, we hope that you can provide some docs, script is better.
4. Please make pr to https://github.com/dubbogo/dubbo-samples instead of https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples. We will synchronize to apache/dubbo-samples regularly.
